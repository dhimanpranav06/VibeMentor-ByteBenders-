## 📚 Example 1: "Python"

### What Wikipedia Returns:

```
📚 **Python (programming language)**

*From Wikipedia - The Free Encyclopedia*

Python is a high-level, interpreted, general-purpose programming language. 
Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant 
indentation.

Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple 
programming paradigms, including structured (particularly procedural), 
object-oriented and functional programming.

Guido van Rossum began working on Python in the late 1980s as a successor 
to the ABC programming language and first released it in 1991 as Python 0.9.0.

### History
Python 2.0 was released in 2000. Python 3.0, released in 2008, was a major 
revision not completely backward-compatible with earlier versions.

### Design philosophy and features
Python is a multi-paradigm programming language. Object-oriented programming 
and structured programming are fully supported...

## 🤖 Example 2: "Machine Learning"

### What Wikipedia Returns:

```
📚 **Machine Learning**

*From Wikipedia - The Free Encyclopedia*

Machine learning (ML) is a field of study in artificial intelligence concerned 
with the development and study of statistical algorithms that can learn from 
data and generalize to unseen data, and thus perform tasks without explicit 
instructions.

Recently, generative artificial neural networks have been able to surpass many 
previous approaches in performance. Machine learning approaches have been 
applied to many fields including large language models, computer vision, speech 
recognition, email filtering, agriculture, and medicine.

### History and relationships to other fields
The term machine learning was coined in 1959 by Arthur Samuel, an IBM employee 
and pioneer in the field of computer gaming and artificial intelligence.

### Machine learning approaches
Machine learning approaches are traditionally divided into three broad categories:
- Supervised learning
- Unsupervised learning  
- Reinforcement learning

## ⚛️ Example 3: "Quantum Physics"

### What Wikipedia Returns:

```
📚 **Quantum mechanics**

*From Wikipedia - The Free Encyclopedia*

Quantum mechanics is a fundamental theory in physics that describes the behavior 
of nature at and below the scale of atoms. It is the foundation of all quantum 
physics, which includes quantum chemistry, quantum field theory, quantum 
technology, and quantum information science.

Quantum mechanics can describe many systems that classical physics cannot. 
Classical physics can describe many aspects of nature at an ordinary (macroscopic 
and (optical) microscopic) scale, but is not sufficient for describing them at 
very small (atomic and subatomic) scales.

### Overview
The word quantum derives from the Latin, meaning "how great" or "how much". 
In quantum mechanics, it refers to a discrete unit assigned to certain physical 
quantities...

## 🌍 Example 4: "Climate Change"

### What Wikipedia Returns:

```
📚 **Climate change**

*From Wikipedia - The Free Encyclopedia*

In common usage, climate change describes global warming—the ongoing increase 
in global average temperature—and its effects on Earth's climate system. 
Climate change in a broader sense also includes previous long-term changes to 
Earth's climate.

The current rise in global average temperature is more rapid than previous 
changes, and is primarily caused by humans burning fossil fuels. Fossil fuel 
use, deforestation, and some agricultural and industrial practices increase 
greenhouse gases, notably carbon dioxide and methane.

### Physical drivers of recent climate change
The climate system experiences various cycles and shifts that occur on different 
time scales. Solar irradiance, orbital changes, volcanic activity, and 
atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations influence the Earth's energy balance...

## 💡 Example 5: "Artificial Intelligence"

### What Wikipedia Returns:

```
📚 **Artificial intelligence**

*From Wikipedia - The Free Encyclopedia*

Artificial intelligence (AI) is the intelligence of machines or software, as 
opposed to the intelligence of humans or animals. It is a field of study in 
computer science that develops and studies intelligent machines.

AI technology is widely used throughout industry, government, and science. Some 
high-profile applications include advanced web search engines (e.g., Google 
Search), recommendation systems (used by YouTube, Amazon, and Netflix), 
understanding human speech (such as Siri and Alexa)...

### Goals
The general problem of simulating (or creating) intelligence has been broken 
into sub-problems. These consist of particular traits or capabilities that 
researchers expect an intelligent system to display.
